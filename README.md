<h2>User Personas </h2>

[ ] As a young person with sensory differences I want clear explanations of sensory terms and self‑help tools so that I can better understand and communicate my needs.

[ ] As a parent I want to find local support groups, therapists and events near me so that I can build a local network of help.

[ ] As a classroom teacher I want downloadable lesson plans and activity modifications so that I can include students with sensory needs easily.
